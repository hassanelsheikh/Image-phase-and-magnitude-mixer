**FT Magnitude & Phase Mixer**

**Description:**
This project implements a software tool to demonstrate the relative importance of magnitude and phase components in Fourier Transform (FT) analysis, using 2D images. Users can visualize the FT components of two images, mix different components, and observe the resulting output image in real-time.

**Features:**
1. Image Display: Opens and displays two images, allowing selection of FT components (Magnitude, Phase, Real, Imaginary) for visualization.
2. Mixing Panel: Forms an output image by mixing components from both images based on user-defined parameters, including image selection, component selection, and mixing ratio adjustment.
3. Real-time Output: Generates and displays the output image dynamically without requiring a separate generation button, updating whenever the user adjusts mixing options.

**Tools Used:**
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the user interface.
- JavaScript: Frontend scripting language for interactive features and dynamic content.
- Python: Backend programming language for processing image data and performing Fourier Transform calculations.
- CSS: Styling language for enhancing the appearance and layout of the software interface.

**Code Practices:**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes encapsulation concepts to organize code within image and display classes, minimizing code repetition and promoting modular design.
- Logging: Implements Python's logging library to track user interactions and main steps, aiding in debugging and problem resolution during development.

**How to Run:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the software by executing the main script.
4. Open two images of the same size using the software.
5. Select FT components and adjust mixing parameters in the mixing panel.
6. Observe the real-time output image updating as mixing options are modified.
